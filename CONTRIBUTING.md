# Contributing to Local Memory MCP

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Features

This project supports **mixed mode development**:
- **TypeScript**: Written in TS for type safety.
- **Native Modules**: Uses `better-sqlite3` and `sqlite-vec` which require native compilation.

## We Develop with Github Issues

We use github issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
